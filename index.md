##“A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play; 
his labor and his leisure; his mind and his body; his education and his recreation. He 
hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever 
he is doing, and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself, he always appears to be doing both.”
— François-René de Chateaubriand



##A message from an infuential person who continues to teach me wonders.

What distinguishes our species is thought. The cerebral cortex is in a way a liberation. We need no longer be trapped in the genetically inherited behavior patterns of lizards and baboons: territoriality and aggression and dominance hierarchies. We are each of us largely responsible for what gets put in to our brains. For what as adults we wind up caring for and knowing about. No longer at the mercy of the reptile brain we can change ourselves. Think of the possibilities. --Carl Sagan
