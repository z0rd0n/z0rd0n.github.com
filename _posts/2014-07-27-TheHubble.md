##We finally bought the boat.

  Dog, woman, and man push their limits of exploration. With learning the skill of sailing we plan to open the world up to ourselves.  We will finally allow ourselves the opportunity to travel the world. We will slowly gain our balance in the skill of sailing with this stout 1976 Catalina 22.  The Hubble, as we have named it, was purchased from a lovely couple by the name of Barbara and Mike.  We spent several hours with these people.  We inspected the boat and accompanying equipment for servicability.  We had to ensure that we bought a seaworthy vessel, or we would be spending a lot more money on the boat in the future. The boat looked used, but seaworthy.  It had battle scars, but looked feirce.  The only discrepancy was bad trailer lights; they didn't work, the lights were rusted out.  So, Brittney, Mike, and I jumped into my truck and drove down to Harbor Freight Tools and he purchased a fancy LED tail light kit.  Shortly there after, we returned to Mike's property and fitted the tail lights and wiring harness to the sailboat trailer.  Quick test and all lights work. We bought it! $3500.00 into Barbara's hand and a sailboat on our truck hitch.  

  The Catalina 22 has an astounding track record, because it is made out of strog and flexible fiberglass.  It was also designed by a talented ship designer by the name of Frank V, Butler.


Here are some specs on the [Catalina 22](http://sailboatdata.com/viewrecord.asp?class_id=200).  And this is the basic layout in the drawing below.
