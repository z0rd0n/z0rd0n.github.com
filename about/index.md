Hello!  My name is Andrew Scott and I live in Tualatin, Oregon.  By day, I am a student of software engineering at Oregon Tech. In my spare time, I am an avid learner of new skills and technologies, reading science fiction, running city streets and hiking trails, sailing local lakes and rivers, and adventuring throughout the majestic Pacific Northwest with my girlfriend and dog.  I am currently building an open source [delta 3d printer](http://reprap.org/wiki/Kossel) in my basement.
